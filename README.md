# special-needs-directory
This is an open-source directory designed to help families and caregivers of **adults (18+) with disabilities** navigate services, funding, housing, and support optionsâ€”organized by U.S. state. This project focuses on the urgent gap in post-18 care, where families are often left without clear guidance.
