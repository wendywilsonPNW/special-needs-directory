# special-needs-directory
This is an open-source directory designed to help families and caregivers of **adults (18+) with disabilities** navigate services, funding, housing, and support optionsâ€”organized by U.S. state. This project focuses on the urgent gap in post-18 care, where families are often left without clear guidance.

> **ðŸ”¬ Spark Test Case**  
> This is a small-scale test case for an open-source, state-by-state directory to help families of children with disabilities find services, planning templates, and plain-language guides. This version includes 3 states, 1 downloadable checklist, and a basic homepageâ€”enough to prove the model before scaling further.
